# I'll Serve Soup 2

## Server and Database

### To start the server if running locally:

First, install all dependencies using yarn or npm before moving on. I recommend npm because yarn couldn't find _bcryptjs_ when I was setting this up.

Run _**npm run start**_ OR _**yarn start**_ to start.
By default the server runs on port 5000 if it is not found at https://ill-serve-soup2-db.herokuapp.com/

## Table of Contents

**Database Tables**
[Inventory](#Inventory) |
[Users](#Users) |
[Locations](#Locations) |

**CRUD Endpoints**
[Inventory](#inventory-1) |
[Users](#users-1) |
[User Accounts](#user-accounts) |
[Locations](#locations-1) |

NOTE: Do not include the id number in any PUT or POST requests. The system autogenerates it.

NOTE #2: You must put quotation marks around the key names in your objects, otherwise you will receive an error. { "username" : "abc123" }, not { username : "abc123" }

Column names are _italicized_ and **bolded**

### Inventory

Used for managing total inventory and individual items. Able to Add items, remove items, update items AND get a list of the total inventory

-   Has an auto-incrementing unique **_id_** number (you don't need to add this)

-   An item **_name_** is required and must be unique, with a max length of 255 characters

-   A **_quantity_** is optional. If you don't add a quantity, it will default to 0.

-   The **_units_** are also optional. This would be useful for entering units of measure for ingredients. Can be anything and is made to be flexible for a soup kitchen that probably does not track the inventory down to the ounce. (example: "lbs" or "bags" for dry goods, "cans" for canned goods)

_example:_

| id  | name         | quantity | units |
| --- | ------------ | -------- | ----- |
| 1   | Chicken Soup | 25       | cans  |

---

### Users

Used to manage list of users and individual users

-   Has an autoincrementing, unique **_id_** number (you don't need to add this)

-   A user **_username_** is required and must be unique, max length 255 characters

-   A user **_password_** is required, max length 255 characters.

-   A user **_name_** , max length 255 characters

-   A user **_role_** is required, max length 128 characters (Though this will depend on whoever creates the registration form, here are some examples: "admin", "cook", "assistant", "manager", "volunteer", etc. )

-   A user **_email_** , max length 255 characters

-   A user **_phone_** , max length 128 characters
